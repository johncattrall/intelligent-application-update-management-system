Building an Intelligent Application Management Update System with Amazon Bedrock


At AWS, we're constantly exploring innovative ways to help our customers manage their cloud infrastructure more efficiently. Today, we're excited to share how we leveraged AWS Bedrock to create an intelligent system for detecting and managing outdated applications and modules.

The Challenge

Many organizations struggle with keeping their software up-to-date across large, distributed systems. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing automated solutions often lack the context needed for informed decision-making. We set out to create a solution that not only detects outdated software but also provides intelligent, actionable insights for remediation.

The Solution

Our solution combines several AWS services, including CloudWatch, Lambda, Bedrock, and SNS, to create a fully automated update management system. Here's how we built it, step by step, using AWS Bedrock's Claude model to guide our development process.

Step 1: Defining the System Architecture

We began by outlining the basic structure of our system. Using Bedrock, we prompted:

"I would like you to create a notification system that crawls CloudWatch logs and looks for out of date modules or applications then creates an alerting system that sends an administrator an email or SMS"

Claude provided a high-level overview and sample Python code for a Lambda function that crawls CloudWatch logs, searches for patterns indicating outdated modules, and sends notifications via SNS.

Step 2: Enhancing with Bedrock Analysis

To make our system more intelligent, we asked Claude to refine the solution:

"I would like to you refine this so that it leverages bedrock to check whether an application is out of date and also give a detailed human readable explanation how to resolve this"

Claude then provided an updated Lambda function that incorporates Bedrock for more sophisticated analysis of the log messages. This version uses the Claude model to confirm if items are truly outdated, explain the importance of updates, and provide detailed resolution steps.

Step 3: Adding Sample Inputs and Outputs

To better understand how the system would work in practice, we requested sample inputs and outputs:

"Please add sample inputs and outputs"

Claude provided example CloudWatch log messages and a detailed sample output from the Bedrock analysis. This helped us visualize the end-to-end process and the level of detail our system could provide to administrators.

Step 4: Creating a System Diagram

To clarify the system's architecture, we asked Claude to create a diagram:

"Create a diagram of the flow for this system"

While Claude can't generate images directly, it provided a detailed text description of the system flow, which we used to create a visual diagram. This step was crucial for understanding and communicating the system's components and their interactions.

Step 5: Framing the Solution for AWS Customers

Finally, to position our solution effectively, we asked Claude to assume the role of an AWS Solutions Architect:

"assume the role of an aws solutions architect, please write an introduction for the solution above, detailing the problem and why this solution will help aws customers"

Claude provided a comprehensive introduction that outlined the challenges addressed by our solution and its specific benefits to AWS customers. This helped frame the solution in the context of real-world cloud management challenges.

Implementation Details

The heart of our solution is a Lambda function that periodically scans CloudWatch logs for indications of outdated software. When potential issues are detected, it leverages the Claude model in AWS Bedrock to perform an in-depth analysis. Here's a key excerpt from our Lambda function:


def analyze_with_bedrock(items, bedrock_client):
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the following log messages indicating outdated applications or modules:
    
    {json.dumps(items, indent=2)}
    
    For each item:
    1. Confirm if it's truly outdated or if it's a false positive.
    2. If outdated, explain why it's important to update.
    3. Provide detailed steps to resolve the issue, including potential risks and best practices.
    4. Suggest any additional checks or actions the admin should take.
    
    Format your response as a detailed report suitable for a system administrator.
    """
    
    body = json.dumps({
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens_to_sample": 2000,
        "temperature": 0.5,
        "top_p": 0.9,
    })
    
    response = bedrock_client.invoke_model(
        modelId="anthropic.claude-v2",
        contentType="application/json",
        accept="application/json",
        body=body
    )
    
    response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())
    return response_body.get('completion')


This function sends detected log messages to Bedrock for analysis, receiving in return a detailed report that includes confirmation of outdated status, explanation of update importance, step-by-step resolution instructions, and additional recommendations.

Conclusion

By leveraging AWS Bedrock and other AWS services, we've created an intelligent system that not only detects outdated software but provides contextual, actionable information for remediation. This solution demonstrates the power of combining traditional cloud services with AI capabilities to solve complex operational challenges.

We encourage you to explore how you can integrate similar AI-powered solutions into your own AWS environments. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see what you'll build next!
